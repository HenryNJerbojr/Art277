            The primary goal of the Young Leaders Conference is to empower young people globally with leadership skills to engage in discussions that affect their specific regions and provide the necessary tools and means to identify and understand community issues around them.
            
            The Young Leaders Conference-North America will welcome young people between the age of 18-26 from North America who are motivated to expand their leadership knowledge and engage in important discussions that advance their region’s well-being.<br /><br />
            
            Objectives of the Young Leaders Conference-North America:<br /><br />
            
            Reach more young people in North America and equip them with leadership skills and increased awareness of social justice;
            Increase knowledge in identifying and understating social justice for the participating youth;
            Provide mentorship and financial support to develop community projects.<br /><br />
            
            The Young Leaders Conference<br /><br />
            Over a span of three days, the conference’s sessions will include: redefining leadership, personal leadership building, engaging with communities, and developing soft skills. The conference will focus on creating a safe environment where participants can engage in discussions about social justice and social entrepreneurship.
            
            Several speakers from academia, public institutions, civil society, and the private sector will share insights on these topics from their professional lens. This will provide participants with a broader perspective of the problem and an in-depth analysis of the current situation.

            Our annual Young Leaders Conference, which has been running since 2012, offers participants an opportunity to host their own negotiation sessions on critical issues facing young people today.<br /><br />
            The negotiations lead to a Young Leaders Declaration, which is handed over to the South African government at a high-level event in Pretoria.<br />
            
            During the conference representatives of government, the United Nations, various diplomatic missions, civil society organizations, businesses, and universities join us as speakers, mentors and observers to the conference.<br />
            
            Conference participants are chosen from top-performing candidates in our Model United Nations Programme, Environmental Sustainability Project and Interschool Quiz.<br />
